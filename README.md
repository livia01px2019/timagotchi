**Project Idea(s):** _Fill this in with three unique ideas! (Due by March 2)_
### Idea 1 TIMagotchi 

Feed and raise Tim! Customize your baby Tim! 

This idea is an educational game that encourages students to do their work and do extra learning outside of the classroom. By finishing their homework, taking quizzes (generated either by themselves, automatically, or by their teacher/professor), they can get food to raise their baby and provide other necessities. There are two possible modes: Individual and Classroom. 

_Individual (Baseline) Requirements:_

* Change your baby’s name + image (the default is Tim)
* Educational engagement (Q&A for some topic, or Tim(e)Management or Trivia)
* Accounts and Tim growth over time

_Classroom Requirements:_

* Teacher can feed it some questions pertaining to their curriculum
* Teacher puts extra credit assignments
* Compare who has the best developed Tim
* Achievement System / Leaderboard

_Nice to Have:_

* More sophisticated interactions/scenes for the game
* Buy your Tim accessories, or items to put around the house
* Multiplayer functionality, where you can visit (battle?) other Tims
* Adopting TopHat/iClicker to answer questions in real Tim(e)
* Maybe integrate with Google Classroom and assignment submission?
* Once Tim is grown, he has baby Tims

_Design Challenges:_

* Account System
* Integrating multiplayer functionality 
* Interactive interface

### Idea 2 Dance Dance RevoluTim

This idea is to make our own rhythm game that is somewhat similar to games like Dance Dance Revolution and Guitar Hero that we all enjoyed playing in the past. The twist would be that in this game, the user could pick any song that they want to play and the game would auto-generate a beatmap that actually goes along with the song of their choice.
 
_Main functionality:_

* The actual game would look a lot like DDR except instead of stepping on the arrow keys in real life you would be pressing 4-6 keyboard keys instead.
* Allowing the user to select any song they want and pulling the corresponding mp3 file from YouTube or another source.
* Automatically generating a beatmap by somehow extracting the main beat and rhythm from the song.
* Maybe adding additional features like different difficulties or even a multiplayer mode.

_Other functionality:_

* Making other gamemodes like the gravity flipping mode
 
_Main Challenge:_

* Actual creation of the beatmap because being able to work with audio files

### Idea 3 Resumake

Resumes are one of the most important parts of finding a job or internship— it is often the first thing that any company will see. Many people have trouble with building their resumes: what to put in, what to leave out, how it should look, etc. As Brown student’s we are lucky to have the CareerLab and all its resources to help us on our resume-building journeys. However others may not be as fortunate. This idea is a resume building online tool that will help you create content, format, and refine your resume. 

_Main Requirements:_ 

* Accounts for users to store their resumes
* Different templates for different types of resumes, customizable templates
* Sample resumes for each industry/job type
* Creating a “master” resume with all of the different entries possible and having a drag/drop interface that will allow you to customize it for each job you apply for
* Exporting to PDF/Word etc.

_Optional Requirements:_

* Real-time feedback on length/clarity/grammar of entries
* Selecting your industry/target job and tailoring feedback based on that (e.g. CS should have a programming languages section)

_Design challenges:_

* Maybe use NLP or find some library to analyze clarity/grammar/custom feedback etc?
* Security 
* Speed for real-time feedback
* Interactive interface

**Mentor TA:** _Put your mentor TA's name and email here once you're assigned one!_

## Meetings
_On your first meeting with your mentor TA, you should plan dates for at least the following meetings:_

**Specs, Mockup, and Design Meeting:** _(Schedule for on or before March 13)_

**4-Way Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 23)_

**Adversary Checkpoint:** _(Schedule for on or before April 29 once you are assigned an adversary TA)_

## How to Build and Run
